      "{'id': '2685965', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxbury%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29', 'title': 'Roxbury High School (New Jersey)', 'text': 'Roxbury High School is a four-year comprehensive public high school in the Succasunna section of Roxbury in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in ninth grade through twelfth grades, operating as the lone secondary school of the Roxbury School District, which serves more than 3,500 students.\\n\\nThe school serves students from Roxbury, as well as from Mount Arlington, who attend as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Mount Arlington School District.\\n\\nAs of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,195 students and 121.9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 9.8:1. There were 115 students (9.6% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 44 (3.7% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe high school was established in 1903, operating on the top floor of a two-story building that served grades 1-12. The current Roxbury High School facility was completed in 1961.\\n\\nChoice school\\nEisenhower Middle School and Roxbury High School are choice schools for the Fine and Performing Arts. Students are eligible to apply for an array of programs including three levels of symphonic band, four levels of choir, multiple levels of dance, an accomplished strings program, and electives such as music theory and Broadway musical theatre. In addition, there are nine select group choirs, a variety of wind ensembles, and two marching bands that allow students to pursue interests beyond the school day in the co-curricular domain. There is an annual fall drama and a spring musical that brings together the talent of the performing arts in a show that rivals a professional presentation. An extensive visual art program is offered, with a four-year college prep track including AP Art Studio, and numerous electives that include four levels of ceramics, three of photography, graphic design and yearbook production. Co-curricular opportunities are also available in the visual arts. Students are eligible to participate if they\\'re in grades 7-12, with a maximum of 6 seats available for new students. Students are selected through an application process with the implementation of a waitlist and a lottery if more than six requests are received.\\n\\nAwards, recognition and rankings\\nThe school was the 74th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 411 schools statewide according to Niche.com\\'s annual rankings in 2019.  Their site explains, “Niche ranks nearly 100,000 schools and districts based on statistics and millions of opinions from students and parents.”\\n\\nIn the past, Roxbury was ranked by NJ Monthly Magazine with the following:\\n\\n2016: 52nd out of 337 schools\\n\\n2014: 102nd out of 339 schools\\n\\n2012: 63rd out of 328 schools\\n\\n2010: 115th out of 322 schools\\n\\n2008: 98th out of 316 schools\\n\\nFuture Ready\\nIn 2017, Roxbury High School and Eisenhower Middle School earned Bronze Certification through the Future Ready Schools - New Jersey. This inaugural program recognizes and supports schools who are deepening student learning and developing a culture of digital innovation to use technology, digital content, and media to better prepare students for the future.  This program is in partnership with the New Jersey Department of Education, New Jersey School Boards Association and New Jersey Institute of Technology.\\n\\nSustainable Jersey for Schools\\nIn 2018, Roxbury School District earned Bronze level Certification through Sustainable Jersey for Schools. Sustainable Jersey for Schools provides grants, resources, and trainings for schools and districts to “take steps to create a brighter future, one school at a time”.  The mission is to support and reward schools who take steps to become more sustainable. “Bronze certification means a school has made a commitment to sustainability and succeeded in implementing significant first steps, while silver certification means a school has made significant progress in a number of categories toward sustainability and is a statewide and national leader”.\\n\\nCampus\\nBuilt in 1971, Roxbury High School is a , two-story building with a cafeteria, one full gym, an auxiliary gym, and an auditorium. In 2003, a referendum was passed to add a music suite and an athletic training area/weight room to the original facility, which was completed in 2006.  The school shares Bryant Drive with nearby Eisenhower Middle School. Behind the school are athletic fields, including a turf field in 2010 and a resurfaced track in 2012. A wooded area was also used for an extensive \"Project Adventure\" program (which included various types of climbing and trust-building activities for freshmen), but that was destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. It has been rebuilt in 2015 on the side of the building near the two softball fields and remains an integral part of the Physical Education curriculum.  In addition to the turf field, the school has one soccer field, two softball fields, a baseball field, three outdoor volleyball courts, a utility field (used for lacrosse, field hockey, and soccer), and three practice fields.\\n\\nEnergy\\nThe school only has windows on the front of the building, which faces northwest. This was done in order to save on energy costs, as the school was built during the prelude to the 1973 energy crisis.  In 2017–2018, Roxbury completed the state sponsored Energy Audit program through the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). This has led to the Energy Savings Initiative Program, which has allowed Roxbury to upgrade its primary systems (including the replacement of all light fixtures, now LEDs) through a fully funded grant. In addition, Roxbury has been replacing the HVAC units, re-doing the roof, and has installed a new boiler between 2012 and 2018 in an effort to be more energy efficient.  The district is also looking into the installation of photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of the high school.\\n\\nGardens\\nUnder the guidance of Meg Fagan, Robin Dunn, the Environmental Club, and Geophysical Science students, a walkthrough garden was established in memory of Mrs. Jane Hopper, who died in 2008.  This flower garden features a couple benches, a trellis archway, many species of flowers, and a pond.  This garden has given the front of the school a major uplift with its gorgeous array of plants.  In addition, two hydroponic tower gardens were installed in the cafeteria, as part of a grant received.  These gardens will be maintained and utilized by students in the culinary classes, Extended School Year (ESY), and many of the students in the Special Education program.  Flower bed gardens have also been created in the back of the school by former student Matt Cordileone, who built them during his Senior Option.  These gardens are designed to be wheelchair accessible so students who are differently abled may tend to them.\\n\\nMurals\\nThe school has commissioned two significant murals to be completed at the high school.  In the Spring of 2008, a mural was completed outside in the front the building as part of Rachel\\'s Challenge, a movement to prevent school bullying through a chain reaction of kindness.\\n\\nThe second was constructed in October 2017 in the main lobby as part of an artROX workshop to take art outside the classroom and bring together three others schools - Wallkill Valley Regional High School, High Point Regional High School, and Paramus High School.  The workshop featured three artists - Ian Ferguson, Lala Abaddon, and Sarah Potter. The mural ties together the things that make Roxbury and Roxbury High School unique, including the Black River winding through Roxbury, featuring Horseshoe Lake, athletic equipment for Roxbury sports, and iconic locations in town such as the abandoned factory.\\n\\nIn addition, a number of other murals decorate the walls, and most of the interior doors feature works from past and present students.  The art department works each year to add new pieces to the building.\\n\\nSecurity\\nIn 2017, the district brought on former Roxbury Chief of Police, James Simonetti, to serve as the Director of Security to improve safety procedures. This included the addition of man-traps, upgraded security cameras, revisiting policies and procedures, as well as improving the vetting of visitors.  As a result, Roxbury was ranked as the 17th safest school in New Jersey (of 237 districts) and 120th out of 10,576 Nationally in 2018.\\n\\nAdministration\\nThe school\\'s principal is Dominick Miller. His core administrative team includes two assistant principals, a Director of Guidance, and an Athletic Director.\\n\\nCurriculum\\nThe school follows the New Jersey state curriculum. In order to graduate, the school requires students to take 140 credits across four years with a minimum of seven subjects (35 credits) each year, but are encouraged to take eight subjects (40 credits).\\n\\nRequired courses \\nCourse requirements are:\\n\\n 4 years of English [20 credits]\\n 1 year of World History [5 credits]\\n 2 years of United States History [10 credits]\\n 3 years of Mathematics (must include Algebra II) [15 credits]\\n 3 years of Science (must include Biology) [15 - 18 credits]\\n 1 year of a World Language [5 credits]\\n 1 year of a Practical Art (includes keyboarding, woodworking, and cooking classes) [5 credits]\\n 1 year of a Visual/Performing Art (includes art-related subjects (i.e. ceramics), band, orchestra, choir, and dance) [5 credits]\\n 4 years of Physical Education/Health/Driver Theory [20 credits]\\n 0.5 years Financial Literacy [2.5 credits]\\n\\nRoxbury High School operates on a block schedule, with classes meeting on alternating A and B days. This change was implemented in the 2012–2013 school year from a 9 period day.  Students have 10 75-minute blocks scheduled across the 2 days, with each day providing students with back-to-back periods of lunch and VIP (Variable Instructional Period) at 35 minutes each (plus 5 minutes passing).  These VIP\\'s serves as an opportunity for students to seek instructional assistance or work on homework in a more formal setting.  Eligible seniors (those who maintain a 75% or higher in each of their classes) may scan out and leave campus during this 75-minute interval, as part of the Senior Open Lunch program.  Other courses will make use of this VIP period, such as Honors and AP Science courses, which will pair a 75-minute class with a VIP to provide additional time for labs.  In addition, freshmen are scheduled to have a full-year Freshman Seminar during one of the VIP slots.  This class is designed to help students transition into the high school, develop stronger relationships with their peers, gain a faculty mentor in a non-academic setting, and engage in curriculum that improves their character and academics.\\n\\nPhysical education\\nIn addition to four years of physical education and health courses, Roxbury implemented a “wellness” elective and a “high performance” elective in the 2012–13 school year for students in grades 10–12.  2015-2016 saw the addition of exercise psychology and exercise physiology as PE electives.  At the same time, a fitness room was constructed, and a dance studio was converted into a wellness room for use with the expanded elective offerings and our athletes.  After superstorm Sandy, a high elements ropes course was rebuilt after the first one was destroyed.\\n\\nAdditional opportunities to earn credits\\n Independent Study Program (available to grades 9-11)\\n Senior Option Program (available to grade 12)\\n College Option Program (available to grades 9-12)\\n\\nThe Independent Study Program and the Senior Option Program allows students to craft a unique curriculum tailored to their interests.  The College Option Program allows students in all grades to pursue coursework through online programs or local college/universities.  These programs allow students to engage in curriculum that Roxbury does not currently offer.  Fields include internships in exploring education (as a teaching assistant), community service, engineering, music, the arts, etc.  Students must submit a proposal for approval and once approved, must document their experiences and make presentations during midterms and finals to share their progress.\\n\\nShare Time Career and Technical Programs\\nRoxbury High Students have the opportunity to attend Morris County School of Technology and receive career and technical training during their junior and/or senior years.  Students will take academic courses in Roxbury and then engage in programs designed to prepare them for trade-related employment.\\n\\nCourses include:\\n Auto Body/Collision Repair\\n Automotive Service Technology\\n Carpentry\\n Computer Aided Design & Drafting\\n Cosmetology\\n Electrical Trades\\n Engineering Design and Advanced Manufacturing\\n Fundamentals of Buildings and Grounds\\n Fundamentals of Food Services\\n Fundamentals of Retail & Supermarket Careers\\n Machine and Welding Technology\\n Plumbing & Pipe Fitting\\n\\nAthletic Training & Physical Therapy\\nFor the 2018–2019 school year, Roxbury implemented an academy called Athletic Training & Physical Therapy that is available to students in grades 9-12.  This program begins with a course that provides a general overview of the allied health professions of athletic training and physical therapy. The course includes information about the history of athletic training and physical therapy, the scopes of practice for each profession (injury prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, emergency injury management and administrative functions). This course is intended to provide the student with an understanding of the various disciplines, roles and opportunities of the members of the sports medicine team. The course will also provide the students with an understanding of the concepts of health care administration (organizational and administrative considerations and legal and ethical responsibilities). The basics of training and conditioning, environmental concerns, general fitness, nutrition, emergency care, athletics and special populations.

Donations will go to Goryeb Children\\'s Hospital (Morristown, NJ) to improve care and financially assist families, while 30% of those proceeds will go toward cancer research and medical bills through Four Diamonds (Penn State Children’s Hospital).  Each year since 2014, Roxbury has hosted an event during the spring.\\n\\nThe idea to start a mini-THON was brought to Roxbury\\'s Key Club in 2013, by then Junior Rachel Synalovski to the late Mrs. Nicole Barbato-Connolly (Advisor at the time).  Mini-THON\\'s are a national movement through Four Diamonds to conquer childhood cancer by assisting children treated at Penn State Health Children\\'s Hospital and their families through superior care, comprehensive support, and innovative research. In 2017, the event went overnight and held a kick-off assembly a month in advanced.  This led to a dramatic (nearly 300%) increase in student involvement and fundraising.  As a result of these efforts, Roxbury received the Excellence in Fundraising Award from Four Diamonds, an honor given to one school out of the 235 mini-THONs at the time. In 2019, Roxbury\\'s mini-THON transitioned to Rox-THON in order to support the Roxbury community including Goryeb Children\\'s Hospital.  Through 2021, RHS has raised over $300,000 through 8 events.\\nRox-THON by the numbers:\\n\\nRoxbotix\\nSince 2012, Roxbury has witnessed the growth of an exceptional STEM program - Roxbotix.
